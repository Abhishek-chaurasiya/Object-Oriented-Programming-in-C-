MEMORY MANAGEMENT  - 
  It is all aboubt managing finite of main memory to increase the degree of multiprogramming to its most optimal level.
   1.Fixed Partitioning of Memory(Contagious memory allocation): Main memory is distributed in some amount of sizes like 2mb,4mb,10mb,etc.
    But there is problem that if a process of size 1 mb is running in 4mb section 3 mb is wasted so this is called internal fragmentation.
    other problem limitation of problem size. 
    degree of multiprogramming is limited and fixed .
